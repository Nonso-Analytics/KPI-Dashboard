# KPI-Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed for a client who requested an executive-level report to present their business performance against key KPIs.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
A customer has requested help from TeSA. They are looking for the BI team to pull together a PowerBI dashboard which they can take directly to their board to show how they are doing against their KPIs.
They are required to show the time between **1st March 2020â€“ 28th Feb 2021.** They will need to present their findings quickly and comprehensively so have requested that the results be condensed to one overview page.
 <br>
The customer has provided you with a raw extract of sales data in Excel format which they downloaded from the company's ERP system, as well as a list of the performance KPIs (in the table below) they need to show. Unfortunately, your client is uncontactable therefore any gaps in the data will need to be worked around or highlighted.
